# journal - is a mini secure journaling tool written in go.
No one except you can view the notes stored. It uses AES encryption to secure the notes. Only the person that knows the passkey can read them. It is very simple to use. Just get started by running 'journal add' to add your first note. Then type 'journal list' to view all notes. Now they are securely stored in your system.
